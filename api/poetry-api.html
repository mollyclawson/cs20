        <h1>API Fun: PoetryDB</h1>
        <div>
            The API I'm using is called <strong>PoetryDB</strong>. It is a free API made for poets 
            and poetry-readers that holds thousands of famous English poems. One can query the database 
            via this API by poem title or author. The data comes back to the user in a JSON format. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            I found this API through its GitHub repository. I'm interested in reading and literature, 
            so I decided to search for a literature-based API. When I made that search, one of the 
            easiest-to-understand APIs was PoetryDB, because the README file was right there on GitHub where I
            could read about the API and how it is used. 
            <a href="https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb#readme" target="_blank">Here</a> is the link to the page I 
            came upon. 
        </div>
        <div>
            I used the "author" option to search by author. I searched for one of the most iconic 
            American poets, Edgar Allan Poe, and display all of the poems that the API returned 
            that he authored. 
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            Two applications where this API would be helpful:
            <ol>
                <li>A school could use this API to display a new poem every day on their site.</li>
                <li>A library could use this API to get and display open-source poetry to their visitors.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
